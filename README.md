# Noah Kahn's React JS Resume Website

Built using [tbakerx's wonderful template.](https://github.com/tbakerx/react-resume-template)

## Description

This website represents not just a portfolio but a step into the world of web development. Starting from a strong foundation in programming, I've always heard good, bad, everything about web dev. This is a project that I'm going to try to keep modular and **maintain both as I learn new skills to show off and as I learn new skills on *how* to show things off**. Hopefully it will also serve as a record of my accomplishments, studies, skills, and more.

My interests in other fields is currently taking priority, but this will likely loop back to updating this portfolio and possibly other web development, I guess I'll wait and see!

### Future Goals

- **Making Objectives**: I'd like to make a more custom interface, some parallax backgrounds, maybe find some cool bits of code that I can integrate into my site.
- **Filling Objects**: I'd like to get professional photos, some awesome projects, and some new skills to populate the fields in this site.
